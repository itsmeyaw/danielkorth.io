Nord is an 'arctic, north-bluish color palette' that was created to have a pleasing experience while coding all night long. The syntax highlighting is very designed for readability and is easy on the eyes. 

Ever since I got in touch with Nord - firstly using it in VSCode - I feel in love with it and have constantly been trying to customize my Desktop to align with the colors. This website, especially the use of colors, is inspired by the Nord theme; in fact all colors you can find on here are taken from Nord's color palette.
