        <About>
            I am 20 years old and currently studying Information Systems at the Technical University of Munich. My interests are in exploring how data can be used to gain meaningful insights and make better/more rational decisions. I am currently focusing my attention to Kaggle - mainly Exploratory Data Analysis & Competitions - and learning about the methods and techniques used in Deep Metric Learning.
